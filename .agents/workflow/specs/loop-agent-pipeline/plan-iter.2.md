# Plan Iteration 2 — loop-agent-pipeline

## Goal

This iteration does three things that iter-1 did not do cleanly:

1. Turns the reviewed architecture into a **task graph with real write scopes**.
2. Incorporates the now-locked decisions from iter-1:
   - D1: `workflow verify record` is the **flag-first canonical writer**
   - D6: external sources move to a **design fork**, not an implementation task in this plan
   - D7: iter-log evolves to **schema v2 with nested role blocks**
3. Resolves the remaining “plan-authoring only” questions inline so the next artifact can be canonical `PLAN.yaml` / `TASKS.yaml`, not another speculative markdown pass.
4. Pushes task authoring past bare `write_scope` so workers can execute from a clear contract instead of reconstructing intent from scattered docs.

## Delta From Iter-1

Iter-1 had the right phase model, but the task graph was still missing the details that would make implementation coherent:

- `workflow verify record` needed a concrete CLI contract and owner
- iter-log evolution needed a dedicated task instead of being implied
- fanout/schema tasks were missing required schema files in `write_scope`
- external sources needed to be split out of the main implementation plan
- orchestrator awareness needed to be explicit instead of buried inside fanout
- `commands/workflow.go` and `commands/workflow_test.go` were clearly shared hotspots but not called out as such
- tasks still leaned on readers inferring goal, verification target, and locked decisions from surrounding prose

Iter-2 fixes those gaps.

## Execution Contract Upgrade

For implementation tasks, `write_scope` is necessary but not sufficient.

The canonical task graph should preserve enough context that a delegated worker does not need to rediscover what the planner meant. In addition to bounded scope, task authoring should carry or point to:

- one concrete goal
- locked decisions and invariants
- exact required reads
- verification focus
- explicit exclusions and stop conditions
- provider-consumer relationships when one slice defines an artifact another slice depends on

That is the difference between a task graph that is merely decomposed and one that is actually executable by a cold-start worker.

## Inline Confirmations Resolved Here

### D2.a — fold-back update identity

Choose **stable human-authored slugs** now. No auto-id round-trip in this plan.

Slug rules:

- task-scoped observation: `<reasoning-path>-<plan-id>-<task-id>`
- plan-scoped observation: `<reasoning-path>-<plan-id>`

Initial reasoning-path vocabulary:

- `coverage-regression`
- `schema-drift`
- `cross-task-conflict`
- `budget-escalation`
- `fold-back-triage`

Examples:

- `coverage-regression-loop-agent-pipeline-p3c-api-verifier`
- `schema-drift-loop-agent-pipeline`

Plan impact:

- `workflow fold-back create` / `update` work in the same task with no extra state store.
- Post-closeout orchestration owns the slug selection; updates refine the same observation instead of creating duplicates.

### D3.a — pre-verifier TDD-fresh gate

Choose the minimal enforceable version now and keep it in the **control plane**, not agent self-reporting.

Gate placement:

- runs in `ralph-pipeline` after the impl-agent handoff exists and before the first verifier is dispatched

Gate passes when either condition is true:

1. at least one test file changed within the task’s touched scope since task-start / task-work commit range
2. `impl-handoff.yaml` includes `tests_unchanged_justified: true`

Initial file heuristics:

- Go: `*_test.go`
- Playwright / JS / TS: `*.spec.ts`, `*.test.ts`, `*.spec.js`, `*.test.js`

Initial retry policy:

- default verifier retry cap: `2`
- config location: `verifier_profiles.<type>.max_retries`

Failure behavior:

- verifier dispatch is blocked
- the failure is surfaced as failed gate `tdd-fresh`
- reviewer / post-closeout flows treat it as a plan-level defect, not an implementation-pass result

Plan impact:

- this behavior lives in the pipeline/control-plane cluster, not inside verifier prompts
- iter-log v2 auto-populates `impl.self_assessment.tdd_refresh_performed`

## Task Graph

### Foundations / independent starts

These can begin immediately once the canonical plan exists:

- `p1-pipeline-control`
- `p2-impl-agent-surface`
- `p3a-result-schema`
- `p8-orchestrator-awareness`
- `p9-sources-design-fork`

### Verifier and reviewer surfaces

These unblock once the base verification contract exists:

- `p3b-unit-verifier` depends on `p3a-result-schema`
- `p3c-api-verifier` depends on `p3a-result-schema`
- `p3d-ui-verifier` depends on `p3a-result-schema`
- `p3e-batch-verifier` depends on `p3a-result-schema`
- `p3f-streaming-verifier` depends on `p3a-result-schema`
- `p4-review-agent` depends on `p3a-result-schema`

### Integration / control-plane convergence

- `p5-iter-log-v2` depends on `p2-impl-agent-surface`, `p3a-result-schema`, `p4-review-agent`
- `p6-fanout-dispatch` depends on `p2-impl-agent-surface`, `p3a-result-schema`, `p3b-unit-verifier`, `p3c-api-verifier`, `p3d-ui-verifier`, `p3e-batch-verifier`, `p3f-streaming-verifier`, `p4-review-agent`, `p8-orchestrator-awareness`
- `p7-post-closeout` depends on `p1-pipeline-control`, `p4-review-agent`, `p5-iter-log-v2`

Depends on:
none

Repo `write_scope`:

- `bin/tests/ralph-pipeline`
- `bin/tests/ralph-orchestrate`
- `commands/workflow.go`
- `commands/workflow_test.go`

Delivers:

- `RALPH_RUN_PLAN` loop mode using `workflow next --json --plan <id>` when supported, otherwise `workflow tasks` fallback

Depends on:
none

Verification:

- design doc completeness against D6.a TOC

## Shared Hotspots And Sequencing Constraints

The graph above is the **logical** dependency graph. It is not the same thing as a safe parallel implementation plan.

### Shared code hotspots

These paths are multi-task hotspots and should not be parallelized naively:

- `commands/workflow.go`
- `commands/workflow_test.go`
- `bin/tests/ralph-orchestrate`
- `bin/tests/ralph-pipeline`
- `docs/LOOP_ORCHESTRATION_SPEC.md`

### Safe parallelism

These are good early parallel candidates:

- `p3b-unit-verifier`
- `p3c-api-verifier`
- `p3d-ui-verifier`
- `p3e-batch-verifier`
- `p3f-streaming-verifier`
- `p9-sources-design-fork`

### Forced sequencing cluster

Treat this as a likely sequential or tightly coordinated cluster because it shares command/control-plane code:

1. `p1-pipeline-control`
2. `p4-review-agent`
3. `p5-iter-log-v2`
4. `p6-fanout-dispatch`
5. `p7-post-closeout`

`p8-orchestrator-awareness` can land early, but it also shares `ralph-orchestrate` / `ralph-pipeline`, so it should either land before `p6` or be folded into the same wave.

## Canonical PLAN/TASKS Authoring Notes

When converting this into canonical workflow artifacts:

- keep `p9-sources-design-fork` in the same plan only as a **doc-only placeholder**
- do not reintroduce the old `p7-external-sources` implementation scope
- keep `p4-review-agent` and `p5-iter-log-v2` separate; they touch the same command file but they solve different contracts
- preserve `p8-orchestrator-awareness` as its own task instead of burying it inside fanout
- mark `commands/workflow.go` and `commands/workflow_test.go` as hotspot notes in task `notes`

## Exit Condition For Iter-2

Iter-2 is complete when the canonical `PLAN.yaml` / `TASKS.yaml` can be authored directly from this document without reopening:

- D1 or D7 shape questions
- external-sources scope
- fold-back update identity
- pre-verifier TDD gate ownership
- orchestrator-awareness ownership
