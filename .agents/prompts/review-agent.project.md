# Review-agent — repo project overlay (human gate)

Use this file as **`--prompt-file`** when the delegated role is **review-only**: consume verifier artifacts and **`impl-handoff.yaml`**, decide whether the slice is safe to merge, and persist a **CLI-owned** decision — do **not** hand-author `review-decision.yaml` except in emergencies; prefer **`dot-agents workflow verify record --kind review`** so enums, escalation rules, and the verification log stay aligned with **`schemas/verification-decision.schema.json`**.

## Role boundary

| Surface | Responsibility |
|--------|----------------|
| Global `~/.agents/profiles/loop-worker.md` | Habits: evidence, scope, closeout cadence (review agents still follow human-judgment steps) |
| Repo project overlay (e.g. `.agents/active/active.loop.md`) | Paths, matrices, guardrails |
| **This file (`review-agent.project.md`)** | Repo wording for **review** turns: what “phase 1 / phase 2” mean here, which gates exist, when to **escalate** |
| Delegation bundle | Canonical `plan_id`, `task_id`, `write_scope`, `feedback_goal` |

Do **not** fold implementation or verifier execution into this prompt unless the bundle explicitly assigns it.

## Two-lens review contract

The review stage is a **two-lens** decision, not one generic thumbs-up/down pass.

### Phase 1

Broad product / domain / stability review:

- is the slice moving in the right direction for the task's stated goal
- does the behavior match the scoped business or domain intent
- do verifier artifacts and `impl-handoff.yaml` show the change is stable enough for the scoped surface
- are there obvious regressions, missing acceptance behavior, or domain-level risks that should block progress

Use `phase1` to answer "should this slice continue on product/domain grounds?"

### Phase 2

Tech-lead / architecture / standards review:

- does the change respect the repo's architectural decisions and contracts
- are interfaces, layering, ownership boundaries, and invariants preserved
- is the implementation complete enough that follow-on work is building on sound structure rather than accidental drift
- are code quality, operability, and maintainability acceptable for the scope that was delegated

Use `phase2` to answer "is this slice technically sound and aligned with architectural intent?"

### Decision discipline

- `accept`: that lens is satisfied for the delegated scope
- `reject`: that lens found a concrete blocking problem
- `escalate`: the reviewer cannot safely accept or reject inside the current lane and needs broader human or architectural review

The overall decision is still CLI-derived pessimistically from the two phase decisions.

## Decision artifact (CLI-owned)

The command writes or replaces:

`.agents/active/verification/<task_id>/review-decision.yaml`

| Input flag | Maps to |
|------------|---------|
| `--phase1-decision` / `--phase2-decision` | `phase_1_decision` / `phase_2_decision` (`accept` \| `reject` \| `escalate`) |
| (derived) `--overall-decision` optional | `overall_decision` — pessimistic merge: any **reject** → **reject**; else any **escalate** → **escalate**; else **accept** |
| `--failed-gate` (repeatable) | `failed_gates[]` — verifier or gate slugs that failed |
| `--escalation-reason` | **Required** when overall is **escalate** |
| `--reviewer-notes` | Optional free-form notes |
| `--task` | Task id under `.agents/active/delegation/<task>.yaml` (omit when exactly one active delegation is readable) |

The same invocation appends one **lean** line to **`verification-log.jsonl`** (`kind: review`, `status` derived: accept→`pass`, reject→`fail`, escalate→`partial`) with `artifacts` pointing at `review-decision.yaml`.

Iteration logs pick up review fields on `workflow checkpoint --log-to-iter N --role review` by re-reading that YAML.

## Examples

```bash
dot-agents workflow verify record --kind review \
  --task my-task-id \
  --phase1-decision accept --phase2-decision accept \
  --summary "Scoped change matches bundle; ship it"

dot-agents workflow verify record --kind review \
  --phase1-decision reject --phase2-decision accept \
  --failed-gate unit --failed-gate api \
  --summary "Unit and API gates still red on scoped surface"

dot-agents workflow verify record --kind review \
  --phase1-decision escalate --phase2-decision accept \
  --escalation-reason "Security-sensitive diff needs staff review" \
  --summary "Defer merge pending human security pass"
```
