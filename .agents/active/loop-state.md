# Loop State

Last updated: 2026-04-11
Iteration: 12

## Current Position

Driving specs:
- `docs/WORKFLOW_AUTOMATION_FOLLOW_ON_SPEC.md` — post-MVP workflow automation waves
- `docs/KNOWLEDGE_GRAPH_SUBPROJECT_SPEC.md` — KG subsystem with code-structure layer

Active waves:
- `resource-intent-centralization`: Phase 4 COMPLETE (2026-04-11). All 4 platform adapters (claude, codex, opencode, copilot) now delegate shared-target writes to the command-layer CollectAndExecuteSharedTargetPlan; createSkillsLinks is a no-op for shared targets. Next: Phase 5 (unify command consumers: remove, status, explain registry).
- `crg-kg-integration`: Phases A-D complete. Phase E (Postgres backend) and Phase F (Go MCP server) remain active; Phase G deferred.

Blocked waves:
- `platform-dir-unification`
- `refresh-skill-relink`
- `skill-import-streamline`
These were blocked on `resource-intent-centralization`; may now be unblocked. Evaluate at start of next iteration.

State summary:
- 30/41 commands tested (kg health now exercised: uninitialized state)
- 13 scenario families covered
- Phase 4 complete — all adapter thinning done; ExecuteSharedSkillMirrorPlan has zero callers outside its own file
- Many archived/completed plans still contain stale unchecked boxes; trust the `Status:` header, not unchecked items

Supervisor note from iteration 12:
- Thinned codex, opencode, and copilot createSkillsLinks to return nil (3 files, 1 line each). No stage1 tests to update (none assert skills from these adapters directly). All tests pass (go test ./...).
- `kg health` exercised for first time: cleanly reports uninitialized state (kg-uninitialized scenario).
- `workflow health` confirmed stable after adapter thinning.
- `ExecuteSharedSkillMirrorPlan` now has zero callers from adapters; it remains in resource_plan.go but is effectively dead code until it is either repurposed or removed in Phase 5.
- Next iteration should evaluate whether blocked waves are now unblocked, then start Phase 5 or the first blocked wave.

## Next Iteration Playbook

Phase 4 is complete. Evaluate next wave selection at start of iteration 13.

Candidate paths (in priority order):
1. **Check unblocked waves**: `platform-dir-unification`, `refresh-skill-relink`, `skill-import-streamline` were blocked on resource-intent-centralization — verify their current Status header and pick the best next wave
2. **resource-intent-centralization Phase 5**: update `remove`, `status`, and `explain` to use the same resource registry; update `explain` to read from the actual managed resource state
3. **crg-kg-integration Phase E**: Postgres backend for GraphStore

Preferred feedback goal for next iteration:
- Answer: "Do the previously blocked waves become actionable now that Phase 4 is complete, or are there deeper dependencies that still block them?"

Command-feedback priorities:
- First: read blocked wave plan files to evaluate readiness
- Prefer a new uncovered command/scenario over repeating bootstrap chains
- Uncovered: `workflow tasks`, `workflow advance`, `kg lint`, `kg build`, `kg update`, `workflow sweep --dry-run`

Known baseline CLI noise:
- `status` / `doctor` warn about 4 broken Claude skill links in user config
- `doctor` warns that the `dot-agents` git source is not yet fetched
- Treat these as baseline environment noise unless the current iteration changes their underlying code path

Cleanup note for future iteration:
- `ExecuteSharedSkillMirrorPlan` in resource_plan.go now has zero callers from adapters. Consider removing it in Phase 5 or marking it internal-only.

## Analysis Readiness

Questions the later analysis phase should be able to answer:
- Which commands are reliable only on happy paths vs across realistic repo states?
- Which workflow states produce the most retries, ambiguity, or operator intervention?
- Which outputs are correct but still create UX friction or weak operator guidance?
- Which agent loops stay tightly scoped vs drift or require cleanup work afterward?

Signals already captured:
- Per-iteration summary, scope, retries, commit, and basic self-assessment
- Exact CLI invocations with short output snapshots and structured metadata (scenario, expectation, follow-on, classification)
- A clearer distinction between high-signal feedback traces and low-signal baseline health rechecks
- Command-level coverage tracking (28 of ~41 commands now tested)
- Scenario coverage grouped by workflow, KG, CRG, bridge/config, delegation, integration, and outcome-quality families
- The `ResourceIntent` contract and the first `ResourcePlan` builder/executor slice are now codified in Go with validation, dedupe/conflict, and imported-dir convergence tests
- Write-command-path traces: kg warm, kg link CRUD, workflow checkpoint
- Empty-state traces: kg health/query/lint (no KG_HOME), workflow tasks/plan (no PLAN.yaml), kg flows (no igraph)
- Warning-state traces: kg link orphan, workflow status next-action parsing, kg flows misleading help text
- Before/after traces: workflow health warn→healthy after checkpoint write
- Small integration traces already exist, especially status/doctor/workflow-health and checkpoint→health improvement; these now anchor the first bootstrap and closeout stacks
- `dot-agents explain` now exposes the centralized shared-skill ownership model, giving a safe read-only diagnostic surface for planner-aware iterations

Signals still missing or too weak:
- A live command trace that proves the new planner is aggregated once at the command layer during a projection-style run, not just inside per-platform skill emitters and explain text
- Evidence that the post-skills planner shape can absorb canonical `agents/` projections without another ownership-model fork
- Canonical workflow state transitions: `workflow advance`, `workflow verify`, and plan/task flows with real `PLAN.yaml` + `TASKS.yaml` (workflow log now covered)
- Delegation lifecycle: `workflow fanout` and `workflow merge-back`, including conflict/error paths
- Cross-project remediation: `workflow sweep` dry-run/apply and drift cases that detect real stale state rather than empty/no-op results
- Initialized KG lifecycle: `kg setup`, `kg ingest`, `kg queue`, `kg query`, `kg lint`, `kg maintain`, and `kg sync`
- CRG end-to-end build/update traces and subprocess failure paths, not just read/query style commands
- Bridge/config states for both `workflow graph` and `kg bridge`
- `add`/`install`/`refresh` commands not exercised directly — indirect confidence from clean test suite post-refactor, but no live integration trace of the managed-file-restore-stack pattern

Minimum capture rules for remaining work:
- Every iteration should declare one or more scenario tags from the family buckets below; when possible, include both one command-coverage gain and one state-transition gain
- Every CLI trace should record whether the result was expected, unexpected, or informative-but-nonblocking
- Every retry or detour should leave an Error Log entry even if the final outcome is green
- Prefer paired state coverage when useful: uninitialized vs initialized, disabled vs enabled, dry-run vs apply, empty vs populated, raw vs postprocess-complete

## Scenario Coverage

Coverage is grouped by state family so later analysis can distinguish "which command ran" from "what situation it exercised."

### Cross-Subsystem Integration Checks

These are larger chained checks that cross subsystem boundaries. Grouping them by stack type makes it easier to ask later whether the system is strongest at bootstrap, reconciliation, analysis, or closeout work.

#### Bootstrap Stacks

| Scenario | Covered | Last Iteration | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `repo-health-stack` | yes | 7 | Re-run after the `ResourceIntent` model commit; `status` → `workflow health` → `doctor` stayed coherent end-to-end on the current branch |
| `project-add-health-stack` | no | - | would cover `add` -> `status` -> `doctor` -> `workflow status` for managed-project bootstrap |
| `kg-bootstrap-stack` | no | - | grounded in past session history: `kg setup` -> `kg health` -> `kg queue` |
| `managed-project-sync-stack` | no | - | would cover `add` or `import` -> `sync` -> `status` -> `doctor` |

#### Mutation And Reconciliation Stacks

| Scenario | Covered | Last Iteration | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `projection-refresh-integrity-stack` | no | - | projected-file mutation or refresh-style operation followed by `status` / `doctor` / managed-file inspection |
| `managed-file-restore-stack` | no | - | inspired by the AGENTS overwrite incident: detect overwrite -> restore -> `status` -> `doctor` -> `workflow health` |
| `prefs-review-health-stack` | no | - | would cover `workflow prefs set-shared` -> `review show/approve/reject` -> `workflow health` |
| `drift-remediation-stack` | no | - | would validate `workflow drift` -> `workflow sweep` -> follow-up `status` / `workflow health` |

#### Analysis And Readback Stacks

| Scenario | Covered | Last Iteration | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `kg-ingest-validation-stack` | no | - | grounded in past session history: `kg ingest` -> `kg health` -> `kg query` or `kg queue` |
| `kg-crg-postprocess-stack` | no | - | `kg build` or `kg update` -> `kg postprocess` -> `kg code-status` / `kg flows` |
| `workflow-kg-bridge-stack` | no | - | would connect `workflow graph` commands with `kg bridge` health/query/mapping in one scenario |
| `kg-to-workflow-memory-stack` | no | - | would connect KG evidence creation (`kg ingest` or `kg warm`) with `workflow checkpoint` / `workflow health` |

#### Closeout And Evidence Stacks

| Scenario | Covered | Last Iteration | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `checkpoint-health-stack` | yes | 6 | `workflow checkpoint` → `workflow health` → `workflow log` now all covered in a single closeout chain |
| `kg-write-workflow-checkpoint-stack` | yes | 5 | `kg warm`, `kg link` CRUD, and `workflow checkpoint` were all exercised in one evidence-gathering pass |
| `verification-checkpoint-stack` | no | - | would cover `workflow verify record` -> `workflow checkpoint` -> `workflow log` -> `workflow health` |
| `loop-iteration-closeout-stack` | no | - | would tie plan/tasks, verification, checkpoint, and health/log readback into one end-of-iteration chain |

### Outcome-Quality States

| Scenario | Covered | Last Iteration | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ok-empty-expected` | yes | 5 | multiple no-op/empty traces recorded and classified explicitly |
| `ok-warning-ux-friction` | yes | 5 | warnings captured for orphan links, misleading flows guidance, and next-action parsing |
| `planner-diagnostic-visible` | yes | 8 | `explain links` and `explain platforms` now expose centralized shared-skill planning clearly enough to serve as a safe read-only planner trace |
| `retry-recovered` | yes | 2 | naming collision fixed before final commit |
| `retry-recovered-with-error-log` | no | - | retry happened, but no matching `## Error Log` entry exists yet |
| `pre-existing-tool-bug-confirmed` | yes | 5 | `kg flows` help text is wrong after postprocess when igraph is absent |
| `blocked-environment` | no | - | no scenario explicitly tagged as blocked by missing dependency or approval gate |

## Skip List

Plans to skip (blocked, requires architectural work, completed, or out of scope for loop):
- `refresh-skill-relink` — blocked on resource-intent-centralization
- `skill-import-streamline` — blocked on resource-intent-centralization
- `platform-dir-unification` — blocked on resource-intent-centralization
- `crg-kg-integration` Phase G — deferred until Phases E/F land and are exercised

(Completed plans archived to .agents/history/ on 2026-04-11:)
- kg-phase-1 through kg-phase-6, wave-3 through wave-7, workflow-automation-product-spec-review, agentsrc-local-schema, resource-sync-architecture-analysis

## Blockers

- The imported-directory replacement slice for shared `.agents/skills/*` mirrors now exists in the planner/executor layer, but command-level multi-platform aggregation/dedupe is still outstanding before the broader shared-target migration can be considered complete.
- `plan-wave-picker` SKILL.md at `~/.agents/skills/dot-agents/plan-wave-picker/SKILL.md` has invalid frontmatter (missing `---` delimiters). Codex warns on load.

## CLI Traces

### Iteration 12 — 2026-04-11

Trace: all-adapters-thinned-kg-uninitialized (analysis/readback + kg-lifecycle)
Chain: `kg health` → `workflow health`
```
$ go run ./cmd/dot-agents kg health
✗ Error: knowledge graph not initialized at /Users/nikashp/knowledge-graph — run 'dot-agents kg setup' first
$ go run ./cmd/dot-agents workflow health
Workflow Health — status: healthy, branch: feature/PA-cursor-projectsync-phase1-extract-293f, dirty files: 0, has active plan: true, canonical plans: 0, has checkpoint: true
```
Scenario: [clean-repo, kg-uninitialized, platform-adapter-thinned]
Feedback goal: After thinning all 4 adapters, does kg health cleanly surface uninitialized state and does workflow health remain stable?
Expectation: expected — kg health error is actionable and clean; workflow health is unaffected by adapter changes
Follow-on: documented — kg-uninitialized now covered; workflow health confirmed stable post-Phase 4
Classification: [ok-empty] for kg health (expected uninitialized state), [ok] for workflow health

### Iteration 11 — 2026-04-11

Trace: adapter-thin-drift-check (mutation-and-reconciliation)
Chain: `workflow drift` → `explain links`
```
$ go run ./cmd/dot-agents workflow drift
Workflow Drift Report — 3 projects checked. ResumeAgent: warn (no checkpoint, no .agents/workflow/). dot-agents: warn (no .agents/workflow/). payout: warn (no checkpoint, no .agents/workflow/). healthy: 0, warnings: 3, unreachable: 0. report saved to ~/.agents/context/drift-report.json
$ go run ./cmd/dot-agents explain links
[CENTRALIZED SHARED TARGETS section still present and accurate after adapter thinning]
```
Scenario: [clean-repo, platform-adapter-thinned, multi-project-drift-empty-state]
Feedback goal: After thinning claude adapter, does workflow drift expose the project state accurately and does explain links remain coherent?
Expectation: expected — drift correctly surfaces no-workflow projects; explain links is unaffected by adapter change
Follow-on: documented — drift-report.json written outside repo (guardrail-safe, it's in ~/.agents/context/); next iteration: thin codex/opencode/copilot adapters
Classification: [ok-warning] — drift warnings are valid (no workflow initialized in these projects), not implementation bugs

### Iteration 10 — 2026-04-11

Trace: command-layer-wiring-health-check (bootstrap stack)
Chain: `workflow health` → `workflow status`
```
$ go run ./cmd/dot-agents workflow health
Workflow Health — status: healthy, branch: feature/PA-cursor-projectsync-phase1-extract-293f, dirty files: 0, has active plan: true, canonical plans: 0, has checkpoint: true
$ go run ./cmd/dot-agents workflow status
sha: a5ec829 (current commit), dirty files: 0, active plans: 6, has checkpoint: true, next-action UX: still shows "Status: Completed" — known issue
```
Scenario: [clean-repo, command-layer-shared-plan-wired]
Feedback goal: Does workflow health stay healthy after command-layer wiring?
Expectation: expected — command-layer addition is backward-compatible; shared plan runs at command startup before platforms
Follow-on: documented — next iteration: thin platform adapters starting with claude.go
Classification: [ok]

### Iteration 9 — 2026-04-11

Trace: planner-diagnostic-stable-after-interface-expansion (analysis/readback)
Chain: `explain links` → `workflow health`
```
$ go run ./cmd/dot-agents explain links
[CENTRALIZED SHARED TARGETS section present — .agents/skills/<name> planned centrally before writes]
$ go run ./cmd/dot-agents workflow health
Workflow Health — status: healthy, branch: feature/PA-cursor-projectsync-phase1-extract-293f, dirty files: 0, has active plan: true, canonical plans: 0, has checkpoint: true
```
Scenario: [clean-repo, planner-diagnostic-visible]
Feedback goal: Does explain links still surface planner correctly, and does workflow health stay clean after the interface expansion?
Expectation: expected — interface addition is backward-compatible; explain and health surfaces are unaffected
Follow-on: documented — next iteration: wire command layer; feedback goal becomes "was .agents/skills written once not 4x?"
Classification: [ok]

### Iteration 8 — 2026-04-11

Trace: planner-diagnostic-visible (analysis/readback stack)
Chain: `explain links` → `explain platforms`
```
$ go run ./cmd/dot-agents explain links
Link Types — added a "CENTRALIZED SHARED TARGETS" section explaining that `.agents/skills/<name>` is planned centrally before writes so compatible platforms converge on one managed mirror instead of racing to replace the same directory.
$ go run ./cmd/dot-agents explain platforms
Supported Platforms — Claude now lists `.claude/skills/` plus shared `.agents/skills/`; Codex, OpenCode, and GitHub Copilot each list shared `.agents/skills/` explicitly.
```
Scenario: [clean-repo, planner-diagnostic-visible]
Feedback goal: Does `dot-agents explain` now surface centralized shared-skill planning clearly enough to make the new planner visible without a write command?
Expectation: expected — this iteration added the first safe read-only diagnostic for the planner/executor slice because `refresh` / `install` remain off-limits under the loop guardrails
Follow-on: documented — the next iteration should move from planner visibility to command-level shared-target aggregation/integrity evidence
Classification: [ok]

### Iteration 7 — 2026-04-11

Trace: repo-health-stack-after-resource-intent-model (integration: bootstrap stack)
Chain: `status` → `workflow health` → `doctor`
```
$ go run ./cmd/dot-agents status
dot-agents, ResumeAgent, payout — all projects showing healthy manifest/platform summaries; pre-existing user-config warnings and unfetched git source still surfaced
$ go run ./cmd/dot-agents workflow health
Workflow Health — status: healthy, branch: feature/PA-cursor-projectsync-phase1-extract-293f, dirty files: 0, has active plan: true, canonical plans: 0, has checkpoint: true
$ go run ./cmd/dot-agents doctor
Installation: ✓, Platforms: ✓ (4/5 installed), User Config: ! 4 broken Claude skill links (pre-existing), Projects: ✓ (3), Link Health: ✓, dot-agents manifest: ! git source not yet fetched
```
Scenario: [clean-repo, repo-health-stack]
Feedback goal: Confirm the new internal model did not regress baseline repo-health surfaces
Expectation: expected — the new internal model is not wired into command behavior yet, so repo health should remain unchanged
Follow-on: documented — low-signal baseline recheck only; next iteration should prefer a planner/executor-facing command path
Classification: [ok-warning]

### Iteration 6 — 2026-04-11

Trace: repo-health-stack-post-refactor (integration: bootstrap stack)
Chain: `status` → `workflow health` → `doctor`

$ go run ./cmd/dot-agents doctor
Installation: ✓, Platforms: ✓ (4/5), User Config: ! 4 broken links (pre-existing), Projects: ✓ (3)
```
Scenario: [clean-repo, repo-health-stack]
Expectation: expected — refactor should not affect command behavior
Follow-on: none
Classification: [ok]

Trace: workflow-log-checkpoint-readable (integration: closeout-and-evidence stack)
Chain: `workflow checkpoint` (prior iter) → `workflow health` → `workflow log`

next_action: Status: Completed (2026-04-11)
```
Scenario: [checkpoint-written, workflow-log-visible]
Expectation: expected — log shows the checkpoint written in iteration 5
Follow-on: documented — next_action still shows literal status header (already documented); workflow-log-visible scenario now covered
Classification: [ok]

### Iteration 5 — 2026-04-11

```
$ go run ./cmd/dot-agents kg warm
✓ Warm sync complete: 0 notes indexed, 0 skipped

Expectation: unexpected — no referential integrity check against note existence
Follow-on: documented — potential data quality issue; `kg link add` should validate note-id exists
Classification: [ok-warning]

## CLI Observations

- `explain links` is now a useful safe trace for planner-oriented iterations: it surfaces centralized shared-target ownership without needing `refresh` or `install`.
- `explain platforms` now makes the shared `.agents/skills/` mirror explicit across Claude, Codex, OpenCode, and Copilot, which is a better operator-facing diagnostic than the older per-platform wording.
- `kg changes` returns qualified names with absolute file paths (e.g. `/Users/.../kg.go::runKGWarm`) — CRG uses absolute paths internally. This is slightly noisy in output; could be made relative to repo root in a future iteration.
- `--brief` flag sends human-readable text from CRG, not JSON. The bridge handles both modes correctly now.
- `kg build` and `kg update` stream output directly; no structured return — good for interactive use.
- `kg impact` output includes File-level nodes in "Changed nodes" section — these add noise; filtered out in the render pass (only non-File nodes shown). Good UX decision.
- `kg flows` help text says "Run 'dot-agents kg postprocess' to detect flows" but the real requirement is `igraph` being installed. After postprocess without igraph, flows are still 0 and the message is misleading. Should say "Install igraph or run in an environment with igraph available."
- `runPyQuery` pattern works cleanly for calling CRG Python tool functions without needing a full MCP server — useful pattern for adding more CRG capabilities later.
- `kg warm` silently succeeds with 0 notes when KG_HOME doesn't exist — reasonable behavior but could print a hint: "KG_HOME not initialized, run 'dot-agents kg setup' to create note directories."
- `kg link add` accepts any string as note-id without checking if the note exists in the warm DB or filesystem. Creates orphaned links. A future iteration should add a soft validation warning.
- `workflow status` Next Action field shows the literal `Status: <text>` header from the first active plan — this is the plan's status line, not a meaningful next action. The field needs a smarter extraction strategy.
- `workflow drift` flags all 3 registered projects as warn because none have `.agents/workflow/` directories. This is by design (PLAN.yaml workflow not used), but operators would see this as noisy on every run. Consider filtering or suppressing for projects without canonical workflow initialization.
- `workflow checkpoint` and `workflow health` work well as a write→verify pair: checkpoint clears the "no checkpoint" warning in health. Good UX feedback loop.
