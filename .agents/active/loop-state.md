# Loop State

Last updated: 2026-04-11
Iteration: 5

## Current Position

Driving specs:
- `docs/WORKFLOW_AUTOMATION_FOLLOW_ON_SPEC.md` — post-MVP workflow automation waves
- `docs/KNOWLEDGE_GRAPH_SUBPROJECT_SPEC.md` — KG subsystem with code-structure layer

Active wave summary (from `.agents/active/*.plan.md`):
- **active-artifact-cleanup**: Completed (2026-04-11) — all items done
- **crg-kg-integration**: Phases A-D complete. E/F active next (Postgres, Go MCP); G (skill integration) deferred
- **platform-dir-unification**: Blocked — Phases 4+5 need resource-intent-centralization implementation rollout
- **refresh-skill-relink**: Blocked on resource-intent-centralization
- **skill-import-streamline**: Blocked on resource-intent-centralization
- **resource-intent-centralization**: RFC accepted (2026-04-11) — implementation planning ready

**Actionable implementation work remains.** The architectural blocker on `resource-intent-centralization` is resolved by `docs/rfcs/resource-intent-centralization-rfc.md`, so the next loop can start implementation there. `crg-kg-integration` Phases E and F also remain active follow-on work; only Phase G is deferred.

As of iteration 5: evidence capture substantially complete. 26/41 commands tested, 12 scenarios covered, write-path exercised, multiple ok-warning and ok-empty traces captured with structured metadata.

Note: Many older plans (kg-phase-1 through 5, wave-3 through 5) show "Completed" in their status header but still have unchecked `- [ ]` items. The status header is authoritative — unchecked boxes on completed plans are stale plan hygiene, not real work.

Analysis prep priority:
- The next loop-worthy improvement is not more summary prose; it is better evidence capture for the later analysis phase.
- Future iterations should leave behind structured trace metadata, scenario coverage, and explicit linkage between commands, commits, retries, and follow-on actions.

## Iteration Log

### Iteration 5 — 2026-04-11
- wave: none (no actionable implementation wave — evidence-capture-only iteration)
- item: Exercise uncovered write-command-path and kg-postprocess-complete scenarios
- scenario_tags: [write-command-path, kg-postprocess-complete, clean-repo, no-kg-home-configured]
- files_changed: 0 (loop-state.md only)
- lines_added: 0
- lines_removed: 0
- tests_added: 0
- tests_total_pass: true
- retries: 0
- commit: (loop-state update only)
- scope_note: on-target
- summary: Exercised kg warm, kg warm stats, kg link add/list/remove, kg postprocess, kg flows (after postprocess), workflow checkpoint, workflow health (before+after checkpoint), workflow orient, workflow drift, workflow plan, status, doctor, kg health, kg query, kg lint. Captured write-path trace, postprocess-complete trace, and several ok-empty/ok-warning patterns.

Self-assessment:
- read_loop_state: yes
- one_item_only: yes (single focus: evidence capture across uncovered commands)
- committed_after_tests: yes
- ran_cli_command: yes (14 distinct commands)
- exercised_new_scenario: yes (write-command-path, kg-postprocess-complete, no-kg-home-configured)

## What's Next

**Actionable implementation waves remain.** The 5 remaining active plans now break down as:
- 1 completed cleanup plan (active-artifact-cleanup — archive when convenient)
- 3 plans blocked on `resource-intent-centralization` implementation (`platform-dir-unification`, `refresh-skill-relink`, `skill-import-streamline`)
- 1 active architectural-to-implementation bridge (`resource-intent-centralization` — RFC accepted, next work is implementation)
- 1 partially deferred graph plan (`crg-kg-integration` — Phases E/F active, Phase G deferred)

Recommended implementation order:
- Start `resource-intent-centralization` Phase 1 (shared command spine extraction), then proceed into Phases 2-3 for planner/executor and shared skill targets
- Keep `crg-kg-integration` Phase E (Postgres backend) and Phase F (Go MCP server) in the active queue
- Defer only `crg-kg-integration` Phase G (skill integration) until E/F land and the new graph surfaces are exercised

Evidence capture is now broad enough to support command-landscape analysis, but still uneven across state families. Read-only workflow coverage is strong; repo-local write paths have some traces; the biggest remaining gaps are canonical workflow write paths, delegation flows, initialized KG lifecycle, bridge/config states, and CRG build/update end-to-end runs.

Analysis follow-on once implementation resumes:
- Prefer iterations that exercise uncovered commands or new workflow states over repeating the same happy-path checks.
- Capture at least some expected empty-state, warning, retry-recovered, and blocked traces; a later analysis pass will be weak if it only sees `[ok]` outcomes.
- Link each interesting trace to the triggering plan item, commit, and any retry/error entry so later review can reconstruct cause and effect quickly.

## Analysis Readiness

Questions the later analysis phase should be able to answer:
- Which commands are reliable only on happy paths vs across realistic repo states?
- Which workflow states produce the most retries, ambiguity, or operator intervention?
- Which outputs are correct but still create UX friction or weak operator guidance?
- Which agent loops stay tightly scoped vs drift or require cleanup work afterward?

Signals already captured:
- Per-iteration summary, scope, retries, commit, and basic self-assessment
- Exact CLI invocations with short output snapshots and structured metadata (scenario, expectation, follow-on, classification)
- Command-level coverage tracking (26 of ~41 commands now tested)
- Scenario coverage grouped by workflow, KG, CRG, bridge/config, delegation, integration, and outcome-quality families
- Write-command-path traces: kg warm, kg link CRUD, workflow checkpoint
- Empty-state traces: kg health/query/lint (no KG_HOME), workflow tasks/plan (no PLAN.yaml), kg flows (no igraph)
- Warning-state traces: kg link orphan, workflow status next-action parsing, kg flows misleading help text
- Before/after traces: workflow health warn→healthy after checkpoint write
- Small integration traces already exist, especially status/doctor/workflow-health and checkpoint→health improvement; these now anchor the first bootstrap and closeout stacks

Signals still missing or too weak:
- Canonical workflow state transitions: `workflow log`, `workflow advance`, `workflow verify`, and plan/task flows with real `PLAN.yaml` + `TASKS.yaml`
- Delegation lifecycle: `workflow fanout` and `workflow merge-back`, including conflict/error paths
- Cross-project remediation: `workflow sweep` dry-run/apply and drift cases that detect real stale state rather than empty/no-op results
- Initialized KG lifecycle: `kg setup`, `kg ingest`, `kg queue`, `kg query`, `kg lint`, `kg maintain`, and `kg sync`
- CRG end-to-end build/update traces and subprocess failure paths, not just read/query style commands
- Bridge/config states for both `workflow graph` and `kg bridge`
- Larger multi-command integration checks across bootstrap, mutation/reconciliation, analysis/readback, and closeout stacks that prove subsystems stay coherent when chained together, not just that individual commands succeed in isolation

Minimum capture rules for remaining work:
- Every iteration should declare one or more scenario tags from the family buckets below; when possible, include both one command-coverage gain and one state-transition gain
- Every CLI trace should record whether the result was expected, unexpected, or informative-but-nonblocking
- Every retry or detour should leave an Error Log entry even if the final outcome is green
- Prefer paired state coverage when useful: uninitialized vs initialized, disabled vs enabled, dry-run vs apply, empty vs populated, raw vs postprocess-complete

## Scenario Coverage

Coverage is grouped by state family so later analysis can distinguish "which command ran" from "what situation it exercised."

### Cross-Subsystem Integration Checks

These are larger chained checks that cross subsystem boundaries. Grouping them by stack type makes it easier to ask later whether the system is strongest at bootstrap, reconciliation, analysis, or closeout work.

#### Bootstrap Stacks

| Scenario | Covered | Last Iteration | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `repo-health-stack` | yes | 5 | `status`, `doctor`, and `workflow health` together gave a consistent high-level health picture |
| `project-add-health-stack` | no | - | would cover `add` -> `status` -> `doctor` -> `workflow status` for managed-project bootstrap |
| `kg-bootstrap-stack` | no | - | grounded in past session history: `kg setup` -> `kg health` -> `kg queue` |
| `managed-project-sync-stack` | no | - | would cover `add` or `import` -> `sync` -> `status` -> `doctor` |

#### Mutation And Reconciliation Stacks

| Scenario | Covered | Last Iteration | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `projection-refresh-integrity-stack` | no | - | projected-file mutation or refresh-style operation followed by `status` / `doctor` / managed-file inspection |
| `managed-file-restore-stack` | no | - | inspired by the AGENTS overwrite incident: detect overwrite -> restore -> `status` -> `doctor` -> `workflow health` |
| `prefs-review-health-stack` | no | - | would cover `workflow prefs set-shared` -> `review show/approve/reject` -> `workflow health` |
| `drift-remediation-stack` | no | - | would validate `workflow drift` -> `workflow sweep` -> follow-up `status` / `workflow health` |

#### Analysis And Readback Stacks

| Scenario | Covered | Last Iteration | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `kg-ingest-validation-stack` | no | - | grounded in past session history: `kg ingest` -> `kg health` -> `kg query` or `kg queue` |
| `kg-crg-postprocess-stack` | no | - | `kg build` or `kg update` -> `kg postprocess` -> `kg code-status` / `kg flows` |
| `workflow-kg-bridge-stack` | no | - | would connect `workflow graph` commands with `kg bridge` health/query/mapping in one scenario |
| `kg-to-workflow-memory-stack` | no | - | would connect KG evidence creation (`kg ingest` or `kg warm`) with `workflow checkpoint` / `workflow health` |

#### Closeout And Evidence Stacks

| Scenario | Covered | Last Iteration | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `checkpoint-health-stack` | yes | 5 | `workflow checkpoint` followed by `workflow health` showed a useful before/after state transition |
| `kg-write-workflow-checkpoint-stack` | yes | 5 | `kg warm`, `kg link` CRUD, and `workflow checkpoint` were all exercised in one evidence-gathering pass |
| `verification-checkpoint-stack` | no | - | would cover `workflow verify record` -> `workflow checkpoint` -> `workflow log` -> `workflow health` |
| `loop-iteration-closeout-stack` | no | - | would tie plan/tasks, verification, checkpoint, and health/log readback into one end-of-iteration chain |

### Outcome-Quality States

| Scenario | Covered | Last Iteration | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ok-empty-expected` | yes | 5 | multiple no-op/empty traces recorded and classified explicitly |
| `ok-warning-ux-friction` | yes | 5 | warnings captured for orphan links, misleading flows guidance, and next-action parsing |
| `retry-recovered` | yes | 2 | naming collision fixed before final commit |
| `retry-recovered-with-error-log` | no | - | retry happened, but no matching `## Error Log` entry exists yet |
| `pre-existing-tool-bug-confirmed` | yes | 5 | `kg flows` help text is wrong after postprocess when igraph is absent |
| `blocked-environment` | no | - | no scenario explicitly tagged as blocked by missing dependency or approval gate |

## Skip List

Plans to skip (blocked, requires architectural work, completed, or out of scope for loop):
- `refresh-skill-relink` — blocked on resource-intent-centralization
- `skill-import-streamline` — blocked on resource-intent-centralization
- `platform-dir-unification` — blocked on resource-intent-centralization
- `crg-kg-integration` Phase G — deferred until Phases E/F land and are exercised

(Completed plans archived to .agents/history/ on 2026-04-11:)
- kg-phase-1 through kg-phase-6, wave-3 through wave-7, workflow-automation-product-spec-review, agentsrc-local-schema, resource-sync-architecture-analysis

## Blockers

- Shared `.agents/skills/*` projection bug: repo-local skill directories are not converted to managed symlinks after import. Documented in `skill-import-streamline.plan.md`. Architectural direction is now captured in `docs/rfcs/resource-intent-centralization-rfc.md`; implementation remains outstanding.
- `plan-wave-picker` SKILL.md at `~/.agents/skills/dot-agents/plan-wave-picker/SKILL.md` has invalid frontmatter (missing `---` delimiters). Codex warns on load.

### Iteration 3 — 2026-04-11
```
$ go run ./cmd/dot-agents workflow plan
No canonical plans found.
```
Classification: [ok] — expected, no PLAN.yaml files have been created yet

```
$ go run ./cmd/dot-agents workflow status
Workflow Status — active plans: 6, dirty files: 1
```

## CLI Observations

- `kg changes` returns qualified names with absolute file paths (e.g. `/Users/.../kg.go::runKGWarm`) — CRG uses absolute paths internally. This is slightly noisy in output; could be made relative to repo root in a future iteration.
- `--brief` flag sends human-readable text from CRG, not JSON. The bridge handles both modes correctly now.
- `kg build` and `kg update` stream output directly; no structured return — good for interactive use.
- `kg impact` output includes File-level nodes in "Changed nodes" section — these add noise; filtered out in the render pass (only non-File nodes shown). Good UX decision.
- `kg flows` help text says "Run 'dot-agents kg postprocess' to detect flows" but the real requirement is `igraph` being installed. After postprocess without igraph, flows are still 0 and the message is misleading. Should say "Install igraph or run in an environment with igraph available."
- `runPyQuery` pattern works cleanly for calling CRG Python tool functions without needing a full MCP server — useful pattern for adding more CRG capabilities later.
- `kg warm` silently succeeds with 0 notes when KG_HOME doesn't exist — reasonable behavior but could print a hint: "KG_HOME not initialized, run 'dot-agents kg setup' to create note directories."
- `kg link add` accepts any string as note-id without checking if the note exists in the warm DB or filesystem. Creates orphaned links. A future iteration should add a soft validation warning.
- `workflow status` Next Action field shows the literal `Status: <text>` header from the first active plan — this is the plan's status line, not a meaningful next action. The field needs a smarter extraction strategy.
- `workflow drift` flags all 3 registered projects as warn because none have `.agents/workflow/` directories. This is by design (PLAN.yaml workflow not used), but operators would see this as noisy on every run. Consider filtering or suppressing for projects without canonical workflow initialization.
- `workflow checkpoint` and `workflow health` work well as a write→verify pair: checkpoint clears the "no checkpoint" warning in health. Good UX feedback loop.
