Quote the rejected `reviewer_notes` into the next iteration's loop-state entry."
    - "Route to `workflow fold-back create` when `/self-review` returns `overall_decision: escalate` (`escalation_reason` is required and present in the review-decision.yaml). The chain still records the review verdict via `verify record --kind review --phase1-decision escalate --escalation-reason \"<reason>\"` (the CLI derives the consolidated `escalate` value from the phase decisions), but instead of merge-back/advance the worker emits a fold-back observation citing the escalation_reason verbatim and stops."
    - "Skip `make build-prod` (Step 5) on every iteration — only run it after a stable section / feature is complete and verification is already green. Treat it as a stability checkpoint, not a closeout default."
    - "Skip `verify record --kind review` + `checkpoint --role review` ONLY when no `/self-review` ran this iteration (e.g., a docs-only edit smaller than the self-review heuristic in instructions/proposal-criteria.md). Document the skip in the checkpoint message; the iter-log review block stays at zero values, which is the documented signal for 'review not applicable this iteration'."

# Iteration Close

Closes out an **implementation** iteration by persisting workflow state through the dot-agents CLI. Typical chain: `verify record --kind test`, then `/self-review`, then `verify record --kind review`, then `workflow checkpoint --log-to-iter N --role review`, then `workflow merge-back` (delegated) or `workflow advance` (direct). Sets `persisted_via_workflow_commands: yes` in the loop-state self-assessment.

**Not this skill:** routing loose orchestrator observations into plan notes or proposals — use `workflow fold-back create` (see `docs/LOOP_ORCHESTRATION_SPEC.md`, Phase 6). **Delegation handoff** details live in `.agents/active/delegation-bundles/<delegation_id>.yaml` — use `delegation-lifecycle` for fanout through merge-back and parent closeout.

## Workflow

1. **Detect environment**
   Load → `instructions/workflow.md` § Detect Environment
   Determine binary path and project name (differs for dot-agents vs payout).

2. **Record verification (test)**
   Load → `instructions/workflow.md` § Record Verification (test)
   Run `workflow verify record --kind test` with test outcome and summary.

3. **Self-review the change set** *(per ADR-0003 — fires AFTER test verify, BEFORE checkpoint)*
   Load → `instructions/workflow.md` § Invoke Self-Review
   Invoke `/self-review` so it writes `.agents/active/verification/<task_id>/review-decision.yaml` (per [ADR-0002](../../../docs/adr/0002-self-review-output-schema.md)). Then call `workflow verify record --kind review …` so the existing reader path picks up the YAML; then call `workflow checkpoint --log-to-iter <N> --role review` to populate the iter-log review block via `mergeReviewIterLog`. Document the failure modes (reject / escalate / accept) and respect the gating: a rejected review halts the chain.

4. **Write checkpoint (impl)**
   Load → `instructions/workflow.md` § Write Checkpoint
   Run `workflow checkpoint` with iteration message and verification status. Pair with `--log-to-iter <N> --role impl` if the iteration log is being assembled.

5. **Finish canonical workflow** *(pick one path)*
   Load → `instructions/workflow.md` § Delegation vs direct closeout, then § Merge-back (delegated) or § Advance Task (direct)
   - **Delegated worker:** run `workflow merge-back` after verify + self-review + checkpoint; do **not** run `workflow advance` yourself.
   - **Direct worker:** run `workflow advance <plan-id> --task <task-id> --status completed` only when the iteration fully completed that YAML task and you are not under an active parent delegation.

6. **Refresh the production binary** *(stable section/feature only)*
   Load → `instructions/workflow.md` § Refresh Production Binary
   Run `make build-prod` after a major section or feature is complete and verification is already green.

7. **Queue improvement proposals** *(if worthy candidate found)*
   Load → `instructions/proposal-criteria.md`
   If the iteration produced a gotcha, rule gap, or hook improvement — use the proposal/review loop to queue the canonical proposal artifact and process it with `da review`.

8. **Confirm self-assessment**
   Load → `templates/self-assessment-line.md`
   Output the `persisted_via_workflow_commands` and `proposal_queued` lines for the loop-state block.

> Before running, load → `instructions/gotchas.md` to avoid common failure modes.
