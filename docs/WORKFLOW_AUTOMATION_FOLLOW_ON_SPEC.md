# Workflow Automation Follow-On Spec

Status: Directional
Last updated: 2026-04-10
Depends on: `docs/WORKFLOW_AUTOMATION_PRODUCT_SPEC.md`

This document captures the next-wave and currently out-of-scope workflow automation ideas that follow the MVP contract in `docs/WORKFLOW_AUTOMATION_PRODUCT_SPEC.md`.

The MVP spec remains the source of truth for the first implementation wave.

This follow-on spec exists so later planning does not need to re-synthesize the research backlog from scratch.

## Purpose

The MVP deliberately stops at:

- orient
- persist
- proposal review
- basic safety and quality hooks
- escape-hatch workflow commands

That is the correct first slice, but it leaves several real workflow concerns intentionally deferred:

- canonical plan and task artifacts
- machine-readable query surfaces for agents and subagents
- richer verification and environment-health memory
- repo preferences and user overrides
- knowledge-graph bridge and integration readiness
- bounded multi-agent coordination
- cross-repo workflow drift and sweep operations
- rollback and lifecycle controls beyond simple review approval

This document defines the intended post-MVP direction and sequencing for those ideas.

## Document Status

This spec has two levels of commitment:

- `Next wave`
  - intended to be the first planning target after MVP acceptance
  - should be considered design-ready enough for an implementation plan
- `Directional backlog`
  - product direction is clear
  - implementation details still require a focused RFC before coding

## Entry Criteria

No work from this document should start until the MVP wave is complete and stable.

The minimum gate is:

- canonical hook bundles are working in the supported MVP platforms
- orient, checkpoint, and proposal schemas are implemented without active churn
- the review queue is being used successfully for real proposals
- repo-local and user-local workflow artifact boundaries are validated in practice

## Product Principles

These principles still apply after the MVP:

- Agents remain the primary operators.
- Humans remain reviewers and decision-makers for shared behavior changes.
- Read-only machine access should come before new mutating automation.
- Shared repo behavior belongs in repo-local artifacts when it should travel with the project.
- User- or machine-specific operational memory belongs in `~/.agents/`.
- External knowledge systems should integrate through stable bridge contracts, not ad hoc prompt conventions.
- Multi-agent coordination must prefer explicit ownership over optimistic concurrency.

## Post-MVP Themes

The next work naturally groups into six themes:

1. Canonical plan and task artifacts
2. Structured query and health surfaces
3. Shared workflow preferences
4. Knowledge-graph bridge and integration readiness
5. Delegation and merge-back
6. Cross-repo sweep and drift management

## Wave 2: Canonical Plan And Task Artifacts

Status: Next wave

### Problem

The MVP deliberately reads existing Markdown plans and handoffs, but the research shows plans are not just notes. They are execution artifacts with status, dependencies, and blockers. A weaker agent should not have to infer task state from prose when the workflow itself depends on that structure.

### Goals

- Introduce canonical repo-local plan and task artifacts.
- Preserve human-readable planning while adding deterministic machine state.
- Support dependencies, blockers, verification expectations, and active-next-task resolution.
- Keep legacy `.agents/active/*.plan.md` artifacts readable during migration, while making `dot-agents workflow` plus `.agents/workflow/plans/` and `.agents/workflow/specs/` the contributor-facing canonical path.

### Resolved Decisions

- Canonical plan and task state is repo-local.
- The canonical format is additive during migration, not an immediate replacement for Markdown plan docs.
- `dot-agents` should be able to index legacy Markdown plans until canonical plan bundles exist.
- A canonical plan bundle owns both high-level plan metadata and task-graph state for one plan.

### Canonical Artifacts

New repo-local artifacts introduced in this wave:

| Path | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `.agents/workflow/plans/<plan-id>/PLAN.yaml` | canonical plan metadata and phase summary |
| `.agents/workflow/plans/<plan-id>/TASKS.yaml` | canonical task graph, task status, and dependency state |
| `.agents/workflow/plans/<plan-id>/plan.md` | optional human-readable narrative companion |

### PLAN Schema

`PLAN.yaml` should include at least:

- `schema_version`
- `id`
- `title`
- `status`
  - `draft`, `active`, `paused`, `completed`, `archived`
- `summary`
- `created_at`
- `updated_at`
- `owner`
- `success_criteria`
- `verification_strategy`
- `current_focus_task`

### TASKS Schema

`TASKS.yaml` should include:

- `schema_version`
- `plan_id`
- `tasks`
  - each task has:
    - `id`
    - `title`
    - `status`
      - `pending`, `in_progress`, `blocked`, `completed`, `cancelled`
    - `depends_on`
    - `blocks`
    - `owner`
    - `write_scope`
    - `verification_required`
    - `notes`

### Migration And Compatibility

- Existing `.agents/active/*.plan.md` files may still exist as legacy artifacts, but new contributor guidance should point to `dot-agents workflow` and canonical bundles under `.agents/workflow/plans/`.
- When a canonical plan bundle exists, it is the machine-readable and contributor-facing source of truth.
- Supporting design and decision docs should live under `.agents/workflow/specs/` rather than alongside legacy active-plan Markdown.
- `plan.md` is optional and exists for human readability, not canonical machine state.
- A later migration helper may derive starter `PLAN.yaml` and `TASKS.yaml` files from Markdown plans, but that migration tool is not required in the first implementation pass of this wave.

### CLI Surface

This wave should add or extend:

- `dot-agents workflow plan`
- `dot-agents workflow plan create <plan-id>`
- `dot-agents workflow plan show <plan-id>`
- `dot-agents workflow task add <plan-id>`
- `dot-agents workflow tasks <plan-id>`
- `dot-agents workflow advance <plan-id> --task <task-id> --status <status>`

During migration, prefer `dot-agents workflow plan create` plus `dot-agents workflow task add|update` to seed canonical bundles under `.agents/workflow/plans/`; use `.agents/workflow/specs/` for longer-form design and decision docs that should not masquerade as executable task graphs.

### Acceptance Standard

This wave is complete when an agent can determine the active plan, active task, blockers, and next unblocked task without parsing prose-only plan files.

## Wave 3: Structured Query And Health Surface

Status: Next wave

### Problem

The MVP gives agents reliable human-readable orient output and a stable checkpoint file, but post-MVP agents will still need to read multiple files or screen-scrape Markdown to answer routine questions such as:

- what is the current verification state?
- what plans are active?
- what is the next recommended action?
- are there pending proposals?
- is the repo healthy enough to continue?

### Goals

- Provide a stable machine-readable surface over workflow state.
- Track verification and tool-health data without bloating checkpoints.
- Keep the human workflow unchanged.

### Resolved Decisions

- Stable JSON surfaces come before any dedicated workflow MCP server.
- The first machine interface is read-only.
- Verification run history is user-local, not repo-local.
- Health state is advisory; it should warn and summarize, not silently mutate workflow state.

### Canonical Artifacts

New user-local artifacts introduced in this wave:

| Path | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `~/.agents/context/<project>/verification-log.jsonl` | append-only verification run history |
| `~/.agents/context/<project>/health.json` | current environment and workflow health snapshot |

### Verification Record Schema

Each line in `verification-log.jsonl` is one JSON object:

```json
{
  "schema_version": 1,
  "timestamp": "2026-04-09T23:45:00Z",
  "kind": "test",
  "status": "pass",
  "command": "go test ./...",
  "scope": "repo",
  "summary": "all packages passed",
  "artifacts": [],
  "recorded_by": "dot-agents workflow verify"
}
```

Rules:

- `kind` is one of `test`, `lint`, `build`, `format`, or `custom`
- `status` is one of `pass`, `fail`, `partial`, or `unknown`
- `scope` is one of `file`, `package`, `repo`, or `custom`
- `artifacts` is a list of relative or absolute paths to external logs when present

### Health Snapshot Schema

`health.json` is a compact snapshot, not a historical log:

```json
{
  "schema_version": 1,
  "timestamp": "2026-04-09T23:46:00Z",
  "git": {
    "inside_repo": true,
    "branch": "feature/workflow-automation",
    "dirty_file_count": 3
  },
  "workflow": {
    "has_active_plan": true,
    "has_checkpoint": true,
    "pending_proposals": 2
  },
  "tooling": {
    "mcp": "unknown",
    "auth": "unknown",
    "formatter": "available"
  },
  "status": "warn",
  "warnings": [
    "2 pending proposals need review"
  ]
}
```

### CLI Surface

This wave should add or extend:

- `dot-agents workflow status --json`
- `dot-agents workflow health`
- `dot-agents workflow health --json`
- `dot-agents workflow verify record --kind ... --status ... --summary ...`
- `dot-agents workflow verify log [--all]`

These are still support commands. Hooks and canonical artifacts remain the primary automation path.

### Acceptance Standard

This wave is complete when an agent can retrieve the repo’s current workflow state with one machine-readable query instead of reconstructing it from multiple files.

## Wave 4: Shared Preferences And Compatibility

Status: Next wave

### Problem

The research shows that agents repeatedly relearn repo preferences such as:

- preferred test command
- CI expectations
- review style
- plan file conventions
- verification standards

Without explicit preference storage, the same corrections repeat.

### Goals

- Persist workflow preferences explicitly.
- Separate team-shared preferences from user-local overrides.
- Route shared preference changes through the existing proposal queue.

### Resolved Decisions

- Team-shared workflow preferences are repo-local.
- User-specific overrides are user-local.
- Shared preference changes require review.
- User-local override changes do not require review.

### Canonical Artifacts

| Path | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `.agents/workflow/preferences.yaml` | repo-shared workflow defaults |
| `~/.agents/context/<project>/preferences.local.yaml` | user-local overrides |

### Preference Precedence

The precedence order is:

1. `~/.agents/context/<project>/preferences.local.yaml`
2. `.agents/workflow/preferences.yaml`
3. built-in defaults

### Preference Categories

The initial supported categories should be:

- `verification`
  - preferred test command
  - preferred lint command
  - whether full-regression verification is required before handoff
- `planning`
  - preferred plan directory
  - whether plan updates are required before code changes
- `review`
  - preferred review order
  - whether findings-first output is required
- `execution`
  - package manager preference
  - formatter preference when multiple valid tools exist

### CLI Surface

This wave should add or extend:

- `dot-agents workflow prefs`
- `dot-agents workflow prefs show`
- `dot-agents workflow prefs set-local <key> <value>`

Shared repo preference changes should still flow through proposal files and `dot-agents review`.

### Acceptance Standard

This wave is complete when an agent can discover repo workflow expectations from canonical artifacts instead of inferring them from repeated corrections.

## Wave 5: Knowledge-Graph Bridge And Integration Readiness

Status: Next wave

### Problem

The knowledge-graph and ingestion layer should remain its own product, but `dot-agents` should be integration-ready so agents can query external graph-backed context through deterministic workflow-aware interfaces instead of rediscovering conventions in prompts.

With the code-review-graph port into the KG subsystem, the bridge must serve two distinct query families:

1. **Knowledge queries** — decisions, concepts, entities, synthesis (from curated notes)
2. **Code structure queries** — symbols, call edges, impact radius, change detection (from parsed AST)

These must resolve through the same deterministic contract so agents do not need to know which subsystem stores the answer.

### Goals

- Make `dot-agents` a stable bridge to external knowledge systems used by agents.
- Normalize query intents and response shapes for workflow-related graph access.
- Keep graph ingestion, indexing, and storage outside the `dot-agents` product boundary.
- Support code-structure queries alongside knowledge-note queries through the same bridge contract.
- Enable skills to consume graph data without coupling to storage internals.

### Resolved Decisions

- `dot-agents` is not the knowledge graph and does not own ingestion pipelines.
- The first graph bridge is read-only.
- Query semantics should be canonical and transport-neutral.
- Provider-specific graph adapters may vary, but the query intents and normalized outputs should not.
- DKG-style shared memory and verification protocols belong to the knowledge-graph layer, not the `dot-agents` core workflow layer.
- Code-structure graph is ported from `code-review-graph` Python into Go and shares the `GraphStore` backend.

### Bridge Scope

The bridge should support deterministic query intents across both subsystems:

#### Knowledge note intents

- `plan_context`
  - get supporting decisions, specs, and lessons for a plan or task
- `decision_lookup`
  - retrieve prior decisions and rationale by topic or identifier
- `entity_context`
  - retrieve graph context for a subsystem, service, or project area
- `workflow_memory`
  - retrieve prior handoffs, learnings, or linked artifacts relevant to current work
- `contradictions`
  - surface conflicting or stale knowledge relevant to the active workflow state

#### Code structure intents

- `symbol_lookup`
  - find a function, class, or type by name or qualified path
- `impact_radius`
  - given a symbol, find everything affected by a change to it
- `change_analysis`
  - git diff intersected with the graph: risk scores, test gaps, blast radius
- `callers_of` / `callees_of`
  - trace call edges in either direction
- `tests_for`
  - find tests covering a given symbol
- `community_context`
  - get the code community a symbol belongs to and its neighbors

#### Cross-reference intents

- `symbol_decisions`
  - given a symbol, find knowledge notes linked to it (why does this code exist?)
- `decision_symbols`
  - given a decision note, find the code symbols that implement it

### Canonical Artifacts

This wave may introduce:

| Path | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `.agents/workflow/graph-bridge.yaml` | repo-local bridge policy, allowed query intents, and context-mapping rules |
| `~/.agents/context/<project>/graph-bridge-health.json` | local adapter availability and last-query health |

### Normalized Query Contract

Every graph bridge query should resolve to a normalized shape with:

- `intent`
- `project`
- `scope`
- `query`
- `results`
- `warnings`
- `provider`
- `timestamp`

The point is not to hide provider differences completely. The point is to ensure the agent always has one deterministic contract to ask through.

For code structure results, each result item includes:

- `qualified_name` — the fully qualified symbol path
- `kind` — File, Class, Function, Type, Test
- `file_path` and `line_start` / `line_end`
- `risk_score` — when available from change detection
- `test_coverage` — known, unknown, or missing

For knowledge note results, each result item includes:

- `id`, `type`, `title`, `summary`, `status`, `confidence`
- `source_refs` and `links`

### Skill Integration Points

Skills are the primary consumers of bridge queries. The bridge enables skills to use graph data without calling MCP tools directly:

| Skill | Bridge intents used |
|-------|-------------------|
| `build-graph` | `symbol_lookup` (verify), `community_context` (report) |
| `review-delta` | `change_analysis`, `impact_radius`, `tests_for`, `symbol_decisions` |
| `review-pr` | `change_analysis`, `impact_radius`, `tests_for`, `callers_of`, `symbol_decisions` |
| `self-review` | `change_analysis` (risk awareness), `tests_for` (coverage check) |
| `agent-start` | `community_context` (orient), `decision_lookup` (context) |
| `split-reviewable-commits` | `community_context` (semantic commit boundaries) |
| `gh-fix-ci` | `change_analysis` (scope investigation to changed symbols) |

### CLI Surface

These are likely escape-hatch commands for the first bridge:

- `dot-agents workflow graph query --intent ...`
- `dot-agents workflow graph health`

These map to `dot-agents kg` commands for direct access:

- `dot-agents kg search <query>` — FTS across notes and symbols
- `dot-agents kg changes [--base <ref>]` — change detection
- `dot-agents kg impact <symbol>` — impact radius
- `dot-agents kg bridge query --intent <intent> <query>` — unified bridge query

### Acceptance Standard

This wave is complete when an agent can obtain graph-backed workflow context — both knowledge notes and code structure — through one deterministic query contract without needing repo-specific prompt conventions.

## Wave 6: Delegation And Merge-Back

Status: Directional backlog

### Problem

The research clearly shows subagents are a real workflow primitive, but the MVP intentionally assumes a single active writer per repo. That assumption will break down once `dot-agents` starts helping orchestrate multi-agent work.

### Goals

- Make delegated work explicit and bounded.
- Require ownership of write scope.
- Produce merge-back artifacts that reduce integration guesswork.

### Resolved Direction

- Delegation coordination artifacts should be repo-local because they describe the work itself.
- Parent agents should remain responsible for orchestration and final integration.
- `dot-agents` may assist with structure, but should not auto-resolve overlapping write scopes.
- Hermes-style coordination semantics are in scope, but literal marker strings are not the canonical storage format.

### Candidate Artifacts

| Path | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `.agents/active/delegation/<task-id>.yaml` | delegated task contract |
| `.agents/active/merge-back/<task-id>.md` | subagent return summary for parent integration |

### Delegation Contract Requirements

Every delegated task should declare:

- parent task or plan reference
- write scope
- success criteria
- verification expectations
- whether the task may mutate shared workflow state

### Coordination Intents

The Hermes-inspired coordination pattern is useful here, but it should be modeled as transport-neutral semantics:

- `status_request`
- `review_request`
- `escalation_notice`
- `ack`

Canonical coordination artifacts should store these as enums or fields, not as raw chat syntax.

Chat-based transports may still render them as literal markers such as `[STATUS_REQUEST]` or `[ACK]`, but:

- `@mentions`
- one-message-per-turn rules
- channel or thread routing
- terminal reply mechanics

belong to the transport adapter or runtime protocol, not to canonical repo storage.

### Candidate CLI Surface

These are not committed yet, but are the likely escape-hatch commands:

- `dot-agents workflow fanout`
- `dot-agents workflow merge-back`

### Blocking Risks

- write-scope overlap is a correctness problem, not just a UX problem
- naive append-only coordination will create drift
- transport-specific agent protocols should not be baked into canonical storage too early

### Acceptance Standard

This wave should only start after the single-agent workflow model is stable and verified in real use.

## Wave 7: Cross-Repo Sweep And Drift

Status: Directional backlog

### Problem

Users operate multiple repos, and the same workflow drift can recur across them:

- stale proposal queues
- missing checkpoints
- inconsistent hook rollout
- preferences or rules diverging from intended defaults

### Goals

- surface workflow drift across managed repos
- allow safe, reviewable sweep operations
- avoid turning `dot-agents` into a continuously running control plane

### Resolved Direction

- cross-repo operations should use the existing managed-project inventory in `~/.agents/config.json`
- default behavior is read-only reporting
- mutating sweep actions should require explicit confirmation or proposal review

### Candidate CLI Surface

- `dot-agents workflow sweep`
- `dot-agents workflow drift`

### Candidate Outputs

- missing or stale checkpoints
- proposal backlog older than a threshold
- inconsistent hook or workflow preference rollout
- repos missing required active-plan structure

### Acceptance Standard

This wave is complete when a human or agent can identify workflow drift across managed repos without manual repo-by-repo inspection.

## MCP And Runtime Query Surface

Status: Directional backlog

The research repeatedly suggests an MCP surface for workflow state. That is likely correct, but the order matters.

### Resolved Direction

- Do not build a workflow MCP server until the JSON query surface from Wave 2 is stable.
- The first workflow MCP surface should be read-only and should mirror existing JSON schemas rather than inventing new ones.
- Write actions should continue to go through canonical files, hooks, and review commands until read patterns are proven.

### Initial Candidate MCP Capabilities

- get orient state
- get workflow status
- get canonical plan and task state
- get verification history summary
- get pending proposals
- get workflow preferences with precedence applied
- get graph-bridge query results

## Rollback And Lifecycle

Status: Directional backlog

The MVP review queue supports approve and reject, but longer-lived workflow automation will need clearer lifecycle controls.

### Follow-On Needs

- revert approved proposals cleanly
- expire or close stale proposals
- archive or compact old verification logs
- rotate health snapshots and generated artifacts if they become noisy

### Resolved Direction

- git history in `~/.agents/` remains the primary rollback mechanism for shared config mutations
- lifecycle automation should not silently delete workflow history

## Ideas Explicitly Not Committed

These ideas are interesting but should remain outside the committed roadmap until further research:

- a generic unified hook runner shared across all platforms
- continuous background daemons for workflow maintenance
- fully autonomous git pull/push behavior across all managed repos
- cryptographically verified shared memory or DKG-style coordination
- automatic deletion of rules or skills based only on inferred disuse
- transport-specific intent-marker protocols embedded directly into canonical storage

## Guardrails For Future Planning

- Do not reopen the MVP storage split between repo-local `.agents/` and user-local `~/.agents/` without strong evidence.
- Do not add write-capable runtime query surfaces before read-only schemas stabilize.
- Do not let health tooling or preferences bypass the approval gradient for shared behavior.
- Do not assume multi-agent coordination can be solved with last-write-wins once multiple writers are active.
- Do not let cross-repo operations become default-mutable.

## Recommended Next Planning Order

After MVP delivery, the planning order should be:

1. Wave 2: canonical plan and task artifacts
2. Wave 3: structured query and health surface
3. Wave 4: shared preferences and compatibility
4. Wave 5: knowledge-graph bridge and integration readiness
5. Wave 6 RFC: delegation and merge-back
6. Wave 7 RFC: cross-repo sweep and drift

This keeps the progression disciplined:

- first make workflow execution state deterministic
- then make state easier to read and query
- then make preferences explicit
- then bridge to external knowledge systems
- then coordinate multiple agents
- finally coordinate multiple repos
