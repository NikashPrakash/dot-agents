# Project Diagrams

These diagrams are derived from the current repo docs and code structure, primarily:

- `README.md`
- `docs/WORKFLOW_AUTOMATION_PRODUCT_SPEC.md`
- `docs/LOOP_ORCHESTRATION_SPEC.md`
- `docs/PLUGIN_CONTRACT.md`
- `docs/CANONICAL_HOOKS_DESIGN.md`
- `commands/root.go`
- `internal/platform/`

Use the first diagram when you want to explain the product in a demo. Use the second when you want to explain how the current codebase is organized.

### Talk track

- `dot-agents` keeps one canonical source of truth in `~/.agents/` instead of hand-managing each platform separately.
- A repo-level `.agentsrc.json` declares what a project needs.
- The CLI reads canonical resources plus the manifest, plans the right outputs per platform, and projects them into the repo with links or rendered files.
- The AI tools consume those repo-local files natively.
- The workflow layer feeds context back through repo-local `.agents/` artifacts and user-local checkpoints and proposals.

### Reading notes

- The CLI entrypoint is thin: `cmd/da/main.go` hands off to Cobra commands in `commands/`.
- `commands/` is the orchestration layer; most reusable behavior lives in `internal/`.
- `internal/platform` is the key projection layer. It knows platform adapters, shared-target intents, and how repo-local outputs get created.
- `internal/config` owns the user-level and repo-level configuration contracts.
- Workflow and knowledge-graph features are layered beside the core config-management path, not bolted into a separate binary.
- The command layer is decomposed into per-feature subpackages (`commands/workflow`, `commands/agents`, `commands/skills`, `commands/sync`, `commands/kg`, `commands/hooks`), with shared helpers in `commands/internal/cmdutil`.
- Test-infrastructure packages (`internal/globalflagcov`, `internal/linktest`, `internal/testutil`) and the auxiliary `cmd/globalflag-coverage` binary are omitted here for clarity.

## Practical use

- For a live demo, show diagram 1 first and narrate the operator story from left to right.
- For maintainers or contributors, switch to diagram 2 and explain the split between `commands/`, `internal/`, and filesystem state.
- If you need slide art later, these Mermaid blocks can be rendered directly in GitHub or copied into Mermaid Live and exported as SVG.

## 3. Slide-Friendly Demo Diagram

This version uses tighter labels and a cleaner presentation flow for demos.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph S["Source of truth"]
        A["~/.agents"]
        M[".agentsrc.json"]
    end

    C["dot-agents"]
    R["Repo outputs"]
    P["AI platforms"]
    W["Workflow memory"]

    A --> C
    M --> C
    C --> R
    R --> P
    P --> W
    W -. feedback .-> C
```

### Presenter note

- `~/.agents` is the shared source of truth.
- `.agentsrc.json` tells each repo what to install.
- `dot-agents` projects that into repo-native files.
- The platforms use those files directly.
- Workflow memory closes the loop so the next session starts with context instead of guesswork.

## 4. Slide-Friendly Current Architecture Diagram

This version is intended for architecture slides where the audience only needs the major layers.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    E["CLI entrypoint"]
    C["Command layer"]
    P["Projection layer"]
    S["Shared services"]
    F["Files and state"]

    E --> C
    C --> P
    C --> S
    P --> F
    S --> F
```

### Presenter note

- The binary entrypoint is thin.
- The command layer handles user-facing workflows.
- The projection layer turns canonical resources into platform-specific repo outputs.
- Shared services handle config, links, hooks, graph access, and project sync.
- Everything ultimately resolves into filesystem state that the tools and agents consume.

## 5. Workflow Engine Diagram

Derived from `commands/workflow/` (`cmd.go`, `types.go`, `plan_task.go`, `state.go`,
`delegation.go`, `bundle.go`, `iter_log.go`) and the workflow-artifact-model rule.
This shows the artifact lifecycle and the `da workflow` command surface that drives it.

### Reading notes

- **Four artifact tiers** (spec -> plan -> tasks -> history) — each box names the CLI
  verb that produces or mutates that artifact.
- **Fanout path** is the delegation lifecycle: `fanout` emits a bundle YAML, `bundle
  stages` expands it into the `impl -> verifier(s) -> review` staged runtime, then
  `merge-back` -> `delegation gate` -> `closeout`. A rejected gate loops back.
- **Iteration close** (`verify -> checkpoint -> advance`) is the shared tail — direct
  work runs `advance`, delegated work runs `merge-back` first.
- **Cross-cutting subsystems** feed the core loop rather than sitting on the critical path.

## 6. Workflow State Diagram

Derived from `isValidTaskStatus` / `isValidPlanStatus` and `runWorkflowAdvance` in
`commands/workflow/plan_task.go`. Status transitions are driven by `da workflow advance`
(tasks) and `da workflow plan update --status` / `plan archive` (plans).

### Task status machine

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> pending: workflow task add

    pending --> in_progress: advance — deps completed, work starts
    pending --> blocked: dependency or write-scope conflict
    pending --> cancelled: descoped

    blocked --> pending: blocker cleared
    blocked --> in_progress: blocker cleared, work starts
    blocked --> cancelled: descoped

    in_progress --> completed: advance — after verify + checkpoint
    in_progress --> blocked: new blocker surfaces
    in_progress --> pending: work reverted
    in_progress --> cancelled: descoped

    completed --> in_progress: reopened on delegation gate reject

    completed --> [*]
    cancelled --> [*]

    note right of pending
        Eligible = pending with all depends_on completed.
        Surfaced by workflow eligible / next.
    end note
```

### Plan status machine

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> draft: workflow plan create

    draft --> active: plan update --status active
    active --> paused: plan update --status paused
    paused --> active: plan update --status active
    active --> completed: all tasks completed
    completed --> archived: workflow plan archive
    archived --> [*]

    note right of draft
        Draft plans are skipped by
        selectAllEligibleTasks / next.
    end note
```

### Reading notes

- **Task verbs:** every task transition goes through `da workflow advance`; valid values
  are `pending`, `in_progress`, `blocked`, `completed`, `cancelled`.
- **Eligibility** is not a status — it is a derived view: a `pending` task whose
  `depends_on` are all `completed`.
- **Reopen edge:** `completed -> in_progress` happens when a delegation gate rejects a
  merge-back, sending the task back through the staged runtime.
- **Plan verbs:** plans move via `plan update --status` (`draft`, `active`, `paused`,
  `completed`, `archived`); `plan archive` performs the final `completed -> archived`
  step and bundles the history record.
